# RPN Graphing Calculator

Written in Swift 1.2, my graphing calculator app requires the user to use Reverse Polish notation (RPN) (postfix notation) in order to get a calculated result or formula.  I made this app in order to apply my knowledge of MVC principles.

Based on Stanford's Assignment 3! This app was made in 2015 with XCode 6.4 because of its swift 1.2 compiler.
